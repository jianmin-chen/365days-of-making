title: Start your own
---

## How to start one

Start by forking the [source](https://github.com/hackclub/365days-of-making) and then cloning your fork and installing the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/365days-of-making
cd 365days-of-making
npm i  # or yarn install
```

We'll also need to set up Firebase so you can get people subbed to your updates. Head over to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), log into the appropriate account, and click on "Go to console" in the top right corner. Click on the big plus button that shows up, which will take you through creating a Firebase project.

Once you have one created, we're going to create a web app in our Firebase project. Click on the code icon that will show up and follow the instructions to create a web app. Make sure you save the Firebase configuration, it'll look like this:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: '',
  authDomain: '',
  projectId: '',
  storageBucket: '',
  messagingSenderId: '',
  appId: '',
  measurementId: ''
}
```

This will go inside `/src/firebase/client.ts`. Replace the current `firebaseConfig` with yours.

That's what the client will be able to use (backed up by secure rules). Since we're the admin, we'd like to have full access to everything, though. Let's set up admin access by grabbing our project credentials. You can generate them by going under your project settings (which will be a settings icon next to your project name in the sidebar) > Service accounts > Firebase admin SDK > Generate new private key.

To add these, we'll add them to our list of environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory, and add these values in:

```
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=YOUR_CLIENT_EMAIL
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
FIREBASE_AUTH_URI=YOUR_AUTH_URI
FIREBASE_TOKEN_URI=YOUR_TOKEN_URI
FIREBASE_AUTH_CERT_URL=YOUR_AUTH_CERT_URL
FIREBASE_CLIENT_CERT_URL=YOUR_CLIENT_CERT_URL
```

These will come from the JSON file Firebase downloads for you.

Head back over to Firebase and open the Build dropdown > Authentication, and then click on the "Email/password" option. Enable it. We're going to set up an admin account with your personal email (or as many as you'd like, so make sure to use the appropriate email. Or you could create multiple logins. Whatever you'd like.) Next, move `setup.ts` into `/pages/api/auth`.

Now we're going to start Astro:

```
npm run dev
```

Head over to the link Astro gives you and you should now see this website! Wooh.

To get ourselves an admin account, let's now download [Postman](https://www.postman.com). Once you get Postman downloaded, you'll see something like this:

![](https://cloud-qw7gr70h4-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2023-09-15_at_3.31.26___pm.png)

Create a new request with the Add button, set it to go to `localhost:3000/api/auth/setup` then set it to be `POST` instead of the default `GET`. Go over to the Body tab and select `form-data`, and add these two key-value pairs:

```
email=YOUR EMAIL
password=YOUR PASSWORD
```

If everything works out, you now have an account! Delete the `setup.ts` file and head to `/signin`, and you should be able to sign in, after which you will get redirected to the dashboard. However, when you get to the dashboard you'll see another error - something along the lines of "Firestore is not enabled". We actually haven't turned on our database in Firebase, so let's go back and do that now. In the same Build dropdown, click on the "Firestore Database" option > Create database. Choose "Start in production mode" - we're going to edit the rules - and then Next > Enable. Once it's done loading, head over to the Rules tab and paste this in:

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

Now the dashboard should show up!

Let's do one last thing for setup - set a start date. Head back to `.env`, and add in a line like the following:

```
PUBLIC_START_DATE=2023-09-15
```

(Prefixing our environment variables with a `PUBLIC_` lets Astro know that a variable should be public.) This will be used on the main page to map all 365 days.

Now that you've got everything set up, let's write our first entry. Remove the current entries by deleting everything from `/src/content/entries`. This can be about anything! For me, I introduced myself, what this was about, why I was doing it, and what I was going to be doing. [You can check it out here.](/entry/1)

Also feel free to edit this page you're reading right now - that's in `/src/content/content/start.mdx`, although it should stay relatively the same.

One last thing before we deploy - did you know you can search for things with `Cmd+k` or `Ctrl+k`? So cool, except the search isn't working - we need to set it up. First things first, we add a environment variable to `.env`:

```
PUBLIC_SHOW_SEARCH=true
```

We use [Stork](https://stork-search.net/) for static search, which makes it insanely fast because all search indexes have already been built. (Take a look at the website for a better explanation.) To use it, first [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and then run `npm run search`. **Keep in mind that this only works on Linux and macOS computers.** On Windows computers, you'll have to run the following manually:

```
cargo install stork-search --locked
mv ./search.ts ./src/pages/api
npm run dev
```

And then head over to `http://localhost:3000/api/search`, close the server, and then run:

```
stork build --input ./public/search.toml --output ./public/search.st
mv ./src/pages/api/search.ts .
```

Run this every time before deploying. (Or create a NPM command to build locally. Whatever works.)

## Deploying

Let's deploy. Set up an GitHub repository, and push the contents of your folder to the repository. Once you're done, head over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), sign up if you haven't, and create a new project. Link that project to your repository, and paste your environment variables where it asks you to.

Now head over to the link Vercel gives you and you'll see your site in action!

## Setting up Giscus

To get comments on your 365 days of making, set up Giscus by going to [https://giscus.app/](https://giscus.app/) and selecting your preferred options. You'll get a script that looks something like this:

```js
<script
  src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
  data-repo="jianmin-chen/365days-of-making"
  data-repo-id="R_kgDOKRAyPw"
  data-category="Announcements"
  data-category-id="DIC_kwDOKRAyP84CZLWE"
  data-mapping="pathname"
  data-strict="0"
  data-reactions-enabled="0"
  data-emit-metadata="0"
  data-input-position="top"
  data-theme="light"
  data-lang="en"
  data-loading="lazy"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async></script>
```

You will need to replace this script at the bottom of `src/pages/start.astro` and `src/pages/entry/[slug].astro`. Once you do feel free to add a "Hello, world!" to your first entry to make sure it works!

## Setting up newsletter

Setting up the newsletter is a tad bit harder. I use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

## Adding yourself to the webring

Please add yourself to the webring! I personally would love to check out other people's 365 days of making. Head over [here](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/365days-of-making/issues) and open an issue with your name and a link to your website, and you're all good.

## Frequently asked questions

**What if I want to do more than 365 days, or less?**

Yeah! Add an variable to `.env`:

```
PUBLIC_NUMBER_OF_DAYS=365
```

**Can I make the excerpts a bit longer?**

Yeah! Add an variable to `.env`:

```
PUBLIC_EXCERPT_LENGTH=120
```

**What's up with all this extra content in the dashboard?**

I left that there for myself! To get rid of it, head over to `/src/components/Editor.tsx` and get rid of `content={`...`}`.

**Is there an RSS feed I can subscribe to?**

Yep! You can find it [here](/feed.xml).
