title: Start your own

## How to start one

Start by forking the [source](https://github.com/hackclub/365days-of-making) and then cloning your fork and installing the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/365days-of-making
cd 365days-of-making
npm i  # or yarn install
```

We'll also need to set up Firebase so you can get people subbed to your updates. (An RSS feed is soon to be added.) Head over to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), log into the appropriate account, and click on "Go to console" in the top right corner. Click on the big plus button that shows up, which will take you through creating a Firebase project.

Once you have one created, we're going to create a web app in our Firebase project. Click on the code icon that will show up and follow the instructions to create a web app. Make sure you save the Firebase configuration, it'll look like this:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: "",
  measurementId: ""
}
```

This will go inside `/src/firebase/client.ts`. Replace the current `firebaseConfig` with yours.

That's what the client will be able to use (backed up by secure rules). Since we're the admin, we'd like to have full access

Move `setup.ts` into `/pages/api/auth`. We're going to set up an admin account with your personal email (or as many as you'd like, so make sure to)

Now that you've got everything set up, let's write our first entry. This can be about anything! For me, I introduced myself, what this was about, why I was doing it, and what I was going to be doing.

Also feel free to edit this page you're reading right now - that's in `/src/content/content/start.mdx`, although it should stay relatively the same.

Once you've written your first entry, let's deploy. Set up an GitHub repository, and push the contents of your folder to the repository. I highly recommend starting from
