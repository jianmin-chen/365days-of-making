title: Start your own
---

First, about this specific one! It's the original one, with a start date of 09/25/2023 and a time period of 365 days, or exactly one year.

So what exactly do [I](https://jianminchen.com) plan to do during this one year? Well, right now I'd like to get my hands to start tinkering a tad bit more with hard(ware) things, and I'd also like to explore low-level computer a bit more too.

So I have a current list of projects I'd like to be able to build by the end of the year:

- [ ] Graduation cap (or any other surface)... but add lights! PCB designed to power a grid of LEDs (e.g., 50x50) and design a [custom programming language](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/lights) to program the lights over Bluetooth with programs like Conway's Game of Life or the Life Engine. (Maybe one to hang on a wall.)
- [ ] DIY typewriter for the iPad! Learn 3D printing (Onshape) and design parts for typewriter (keys, etc.) and then write up to custom designed PCB to have a typewriter iPad.
- [ ] Sorting hat! Design PCB to wire up to
- [ ] Write a explainer on Rust based on stuff you can find at

And some other cool projects that I never finished but would love to finish and do a writeup on:

- [ ] [`faceterm`](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/faceterm)
