Ah! Day four of making!

You get to see procrastination in action. On the TODO for today is to catch up on yesterday's stuff for Blot, which I never got to:

- [ ] Create save and account system with Firebase.
- [ ] Resolve GitHub issues

And the pizza fund bot:

- [x] Refuse duplicates
- [x] Ticket generation with Satori
- [x] Notify user it takes 48 hours
- [x] Load pizzas on static website

And then some personal things:

- [x] House viewing at 4:45PM
- [x] Send out two emails
- [x] Talk to some people about situations I'm currently in

This afternoon, I'm going to start work on the UI for the lights project.

## Ticket generation with Satori

Okay, so I didn't end up using [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori). It's a great concept and super easy to use, but didn't end up

## Save and account system

## Getting back into writing

Two of the things I wanted to work on this year involve writing, so I've been thinking about getting into a consistent writing habit where I do a bit of writing every morning. Just something I want to start thinking about.
