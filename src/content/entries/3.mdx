title: Working on Blot, thinking about games!
---

Ah! Day three of making! Today, I mostly worked on the website for [Blot](https://github.com/hackclub/blot), which is so close to being done but not at that final stage yet.

## Blot website

Here's what's left on the TODO:

- [ ] Build the landing page. (I have no idea how this is even going to look, so I'm struggling a bit.)
- [ ] Create save and account system with Firebase.
- [ ] Resolve GitHub issues
  - [ ] Add link to GitHub
  - [ ] Fix up workshop and gallery pages
  - [ ] Make sure it works on mobile

Honestly, the one thing I struggle with while building websites is being a perfectionist about literally everything. Everything has to look right - which is why this website took me forever to build. I guess it's mostly a good thing, because my websites generally have a nice level of polish.

I'll keep this part updated as I go through the issues.

## Thinking about games

In my first entry, I mentioned wanting to build a game. I had an idea in mind previously, but after some thinking, the idea might be a tad out of scope for me as an individual. However, the people I want to work with are a tad busy + we haven't really laid out the concepts for the acual game, so I'm going to work on building a smaller game by myself. As in, I'm going to put myself in charge of the storyline, art, music, and obviously, code. Here's the game idea, you tell me if it's gas or pass. Basically, you're going to play as a musician who plays the electric piano in today's era. Somehow, you get transported to the 13th century in some random king's court and you end up becoming a troubadour. (Long story.) In this alternate 13th century, all of Europe and most of Asia is undergoing the Black Plague... except it's being caused by supernatural creatures (hint hint, they look like crows) that can only be defeated by music. There's also a prophecy that some mysterious magimusician (a mishmash of magician and musician?) is going to save us all from these demonic creatures... Anyways your job is to save the world and probably figure out how to transport yourself back to the 21st century so you can see your girlfriend and friends and family and generally the modern comforts of life again.

Okay I just read the paragraph I just wrote and that's the most wackiest idea I've ever heard of. My question is **if people will actually want to play this**. I think it needs to be fleshed out a bit more because it sounds like a very cool game. Also, how is it going to look? That's another good question. I mean, I personally would play it, but I also need to feel like I'm not wasting my time.

I'll probably come back and make more edits to this once I have something more fleshed out.
