title: Robotics meeting, birthday gift
---

Ah! Day two of making. I just came home from my second [FRC](https://greenmountainrobotics.org/) meeting ever! It was somewhat boring but we are in the offseason so I mean... what else do I expect? People mostly worked on outreach and I mostly watched.

The cool part is that this all takes place at the [Generator](https://generatorvt.com/), a makerspace in Burlington, Vermont. Surprisingly, I've never been inside a makerspace before but they're so damn cool. If I can get a membership I'd love to take a look at some of the offerings they have.

Today's a Saturday so pretty chill but I watched the first video of Fab Academy. Mostly boring setup stuff. Looks like I might need to get a soldering iron sometime.

Oh, and birthday gift! This is going to be the lights project. If you didn't read the [first entry](/entry/1) and have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry - I'm going to explain it right now.

Basically, I want to build a huge grid of LED lights, something like a 120 by 65 (around 2ft by 1ft depending on the kind of diode I get, they're really expensive). You plug this grid into the wall, and it loads up a program that's already in memory and continuously runs a loop function that's in the program to control the lights.

To change the program, you can head to a website where you'll get a UI that lets you write the program and test it out on a simulator. (I think I'm going to write this in Astro. I think I've fallen in love with Astro.) Once you're ready, you'll be able to upload over WiFi to the board, which will automatically update to show you the output. If it doesn't work, it will retain the previous program.

You will be able to save and share programs with the web UI.

In steps (that's how I like to think):

1. User sets up WiFi username and password on

Since I like to think in steps, I'm thinking of finishing this project by this Sunday (09/24) (not including shipping, obviously). Here's what looks possible.

1. Tomorrow, Monday, I work through PCB jams: [one on making a business card](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) and [one of making an USB hub](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/usb-hub). Both are in EasyEDA, and while I would prefer KiCad because it seems like the more professional choice, oh well.
2. Today through end of day Wednesday, I'll work on building the website and parser for the custom programming language. I may build the
