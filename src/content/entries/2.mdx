title: Robotics meeting, birthday gift
---

Ah! Day two of making. I just came home from my second [FRC](https://greenmountainrobotics.org/) meeting ever! It was somewhat boring but we are in the offseason so I mean... what else do I expect? People mostly worked on outreach and I mostly watched.

The cool part is that this all takes place at the [Generator](https://generatorvt.com/), a makerspace in Burlington, Vermont. Surprisingly, I've never been inside a makerspace before but they're so damn cool. If I can get a membership I'd love to take a look at some of the offerings they have.

Today's a Saturday so pretty chill but I watched the first video of Fab Academy. Mostly boring setup stuff. Looks like I might need to get a soldering iron sometime.

Oh, and birthday gift! This is going to be the lights project. If you didn't read the [first entry](/entry/1) and have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry - I'm going to explain it right now.

Basically, I want to build a huge grid of LED lights, something like a 120 by 65 (around 2ft by 1ft depending on the kind of diode I get, they're really expensive). You plug this grid into the wall, and it loads up a program that's already in memory and continuously runs a loop function that's in the program to control the lights.

To change the program, you can head to a website where you'll get a UI that lets you write the program and test it out on a simulator. (I think I'm going to write this in Astro. I think I've fallen in love with Astro.) Once you're ready, you'll be able to upload over WiFi to the board, which will automatically update to show you the output. If it doesn't work, it will retain the previous program.

You will be able to save and share programs with the web UI.

## Programming language layout

Here's an incomplete example of how Game of Life might look in the programming language, `lightlang` (if you have a better name let me know):

```
# Why did I write a whole parser for this? I don't really know
# Let's make this wrap around!
var rows = 50
var cols = 20

define Cell { x, y, live }

# Exercise: try setting an initial seed!
function seed() {
    var cells = []
    for x through (0, rows) {
        for y through (0, cols) {
            cells.push(Cell(x: x, y: y, live: random(0, 1)))
        }
    }
    return cells
}

var cells = seed()

function getNeighbors(cell) {

}

function loop() {
    # This loop runs every iteration and must be in every program
    for i through (0, cells.length()) {
        var cell = cells[i]
        var neighbors = getNeighbors(cells)
        if (cell.live) {
            if (neighbors.length() < 2 or neighbors.length() > 3) {
                # Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation
                # Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
                cell.live = false
            }
        } elif (not cell.live and neighbors == 3) {
            # Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
            cell.live = true
        }

        if (cell.live) {
            # Now draw the cell if it's alive!
            var color = Color(r: 0, g: 255, b: 0)
            Canvas.fill(x, y, color)
        } else {
            # If it's dead, turn the cell off
            Canvas.erase(x, y)
        }
    }
}
```

Programs will look output an array of objects with the keys `{ color, x, y }`. I don't see anything tough with working on this, except that I need to keep in mind of certain features the language should provide in this context:

- RGB gradients instead of setting individual colors. (Basically the language will do the calculations for you on the backend.)
- Wrap around support.

## Planning

Since I like to think in steps, I'm thinking of finishing this project by this Sunday (09/24) (not including shipping, obviously). Here's what looks possible.

- Before the end of this weekend (Sunday, September 24 I want to have a mini Post-it size PCB out for shipping through JCLPCB.)
- The programming language should be built first, in C.
- Afterwards, I can build the web UI, possibly porting the C over using WebAssembly. (Definitely going to write something up on this.)
- Next, I'm going to learn how to design PCBs by learning how to design [a business card](), [a USB hub](), and [a LED-encrusted level]().
- While I'm learning how to design PCBs, I'll also work on playing with a Raspberry Pi Zero and figuring how to transfer data to it (specifically, JSON like what I talked about above).
- After I've designed those and pushed those out for shipping, I'm going to design my own PCB. I'll design a smaller one for testing.
- I'll get reimbursed afterwards throughout [OnBoard](https://onboard.hackclub.com), although if you're planning to apply to OnBoard, please don't do what I'm doing.
- Once I've received the smaller one for testing, I'll hook it up to the Raspberry Pi Zero and make sure zit works, make any necessary edits to everything if needed, and get a larger version ordered!
- Assemble the larger version, test it, and give it as a late birthday gift :)
- Write a Jam on how to build the entire thing! So that you can build it too!

I would love to ship this project by mid-October (October 15)! Will keep updated in future posts.
